<h1>2. Epistemology</h1>
<p>Epistemology is the part of Philosophy that studies the nature of Knowledge.</p>
<p>(Greek Epist&#275;m&#275; = Knowledge)</p>
<hr>
<h2>What is Knowledge?</h2>
<p>Sensing is our primary tools to gain knowledge.</p>
<p>Can we also use Intelligent Reason? Can we use Belief?</p>
<hr>
<h2>Senses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Seeing</li>
<li>Hearing</li>
<li>Smelling</li>
<li>Tasting</li>
<li>Feeling</li>
</ul>
<p>We can See the colors of nature, we can Hear the birds, we can Smell the flowers,
we can Taste the fruit, we can Feel the heat of the sun.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Intelligent Reasoning</h2>
<p>Man can also understand abstract knowledge:</p>
<ul>
<li>E = mc<sup>2</sup></li>
<li>The earth is round</li>
<li>It is wrong to kill</li>
</ul>
<p>How do we gain abstract knowledge?</p>
<hr>
<h2>Belief</h2>
<p>Most people believe that a God exists, even if it cannot be proven by reason.</p>
<p>Some believe that every man is created by God. Some believe there are Angels.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some people will need no justification. Faith is enough.</p>
<p>Some people will justfy their Faith by referring to episodes
where God has spoken directly to living persons.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Mysticism</h2>
<p>The theory that it is possible to understand reality without intelligent reason is called mysticism.</p>
<p>Is there an other reality in addition to the one that we can see and sense?</p>
<p>Is it possible to gain knowledge about this other reality by using other forms of cognition than
senses and intelligent reason?</p>
